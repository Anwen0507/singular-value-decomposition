# Singular Value Decomposition Visualization

## Project Overview
This project visualizes Singular Value Decomposition as a rotation, stretching, and another rotation. The theorem states that any $m \times n$ matrix $A$ can be decomposed into two orthogonal matrices and one diagonal matrix with singular values:

$$A = U \Sigma V^T$$

## Next Steps
It would be interesting to visualize a transformation beyond the 2D plane (e.g. a $3 \times 2$ matrix).
